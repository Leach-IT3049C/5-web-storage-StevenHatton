## Checklist:

- [x] All of my code is pushed up into a repository.
- [x] Fill out the `How to test the Application` section
- [x] The technical write-up of the web storage selection is below.
- [x] Fill out the self-evaluation form.
- [x] Submit the repository link and list of group members, if applicable, to Canvas.

## How to test the Application:

* Where and how is web storage used?
The web storage is used locally on the user's computer. How it's used is by storing data ony for a session, until the broswer is closed
* What are application use cases?
For this application, the user can is creating a shopping list by entering an item into the textbox. By clicking "enter" or the "Add Item" button the item that was typed will be added. To remove all the user can click the "Clear All" button.

## Technical Write-up of selection of web storage solution:
For this we decided to use Local storage for this application. The data will not expire and can be accesed if the browser is refreshed or if a user opens another window. If we had used the Session Storage, the data would have been removed or cleared just by closing the tab is closed.
## Self Reflection(s):
I feel that we did a prtty good job for this assignment. One thing that I wish I would do is find a font that would make it so it looks hand written and has a notebook paper type of look.
## How long it took me/us to finish this:
Around 3 hours, had to make sure he could see my Repo and that took awhile
## Group list, if applicable:
